Excellent üëë ‚Äî now you‚Äôre thinking like a real founder, not just a coder.
Before building everything, you must ship a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) ‚Äî a version that users can actually use, test, and buy from.

So let‚Äôs filter your list into what‚Äôs essential for MVP, **what‚Äôs next-phase (good to have), and **what‚Äôs premium (future add-ons).

## üéØ GOAL OF MVP:

> ‚ÄúA fully working e-commerce website where users can browse products, add to cart, purchase securely via Razorpay, and track their order ‚Äî with admin able to manage everything from backend.‚Äù

So the MVP must handle:
‚úÖ Full shopping journey
‚úÖ Payment
‚úÖ Admin management
‚úÖ Notifications for order updates
